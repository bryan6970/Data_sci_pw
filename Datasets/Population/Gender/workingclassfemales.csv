"Residents comprise Singapore citizens and permanent residents.  Based on mid-year Labour Force Survey except Census yrs 1990, 2000 and General Household Surveys 1995 and 2005.  Data from the Labour Force Survey are not comparable with those from Censuses 1990 and 2000 and GHS 1995 and 2005 due to differences in coverage and methodology.  To facilitate comparison with 2008, 2007 Labour Force Survey data have been adjusted based on Singapore Department of Statistics revised population estimates (released in February 2008) which exclude Singapore residents who have been away from Singapore for a continuous period of 12 months or longer.
